# Tiaret ITS 🚌🚎🚏

### Problem Statement 🙅‍♂️
People in our city (Tiaret) used to use the buses each time, but they don't also want to be late at work or in school, so if we know that the bus is too far away, they can take a taxi cab or something fast. With our solution, the people can use our application to know exactly where is the bus (in real-time) on the map so that they can decide rapidly.
